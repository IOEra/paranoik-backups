Installation
============

Paranoik is a Python library and it can be installed as such. One of the options
is to clone the GitHub repository and add the `paranoik` folder to the `PYTHONPATH`.
However, this approach has some downsides. For better maintainability rely on the
`setup.py` file and `setuptools`.

Steps
-----

* `git clone git@github.com:jordanjambazov/paranoik-backups.git`
* `cd paranoik-backups`
* `python setup.py install`
