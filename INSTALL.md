Installation
============

Paranoik is a Python library and it can be installed as such. One of the options
is to clone the GitHub repository and add the `paranoik` folder to the `PYTHONPATH`.
However, this approach has some downsides. For better maintainability rely on the
`setup.py` file and `setuptools`.
